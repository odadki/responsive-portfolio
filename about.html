            Danielle Oda is a singer-songwriter from Honolulu, HI. Currently
            based in Los Angeles, CA, Danielle approaches each song with a spark
            of personal experience and pairs them with dynamic vocal melodies
            and visual lyrical lines. Her first musical loves are singing and
            playing the piano, but she also picks up the guitar and ukulele,
            often playing with different textures and arrangements.
            <br />
            <br />
            In her days back home in Hawai’i, Danielle was avid in singing
            anywhere she could. Besides playing at a variety of venues and
            hotels on the island, she also placed in the finals for both Don
            Ho’s showcase and Hawai’i Stars. After receiving her Bachelor’s
            degree in music from University of Hawai’i, she made the big move to
            Los Angeles.
            <br />
            <br />
            Danielle makes up half of pop-duo band “Perry & Danielle”. The pair
            were invited to events and showcases with organizations including
            Kollaboration, Tuesday Night Project, JACCC, 18 Million Rising. They
            released their first full-length album in October 2018 and a second
            EP two years later in October 2020. Perry & Danielle also play
            regularly at Splitsville in downtown Disney and Hotel Indigo in
            downtown LA.
            <br />
            <br />
            Danielle is apart of duo “Oki Talk” with DJ Oggy where they write
            and produce songs regularly. While many of their songs are EDM, they
            are unafraid of writing a mix of pop, country, R&B, and hip hop,
            making their song roster extra expansive and diverse. A handful of
            these songs can be found and used at Epic Music LA. Currently, the
            have written and produced over 50 songs, striving for each one to be
            better than the last.
