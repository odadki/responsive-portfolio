              Danielle Oda is a singer-songwriter from Honolulu, HI. Currently
              based in Los Angeles, CA, Danielle approaches each song with a
              spark of personal experience and pairs them with dynamic vocal
              melodies and visual lyrical lines. Her first musical loves are
              singing and playing the piano, but she also picks up the guitar
              and ukulele, often playing with different textures and
              arrangements.
              <br />
              <br />
              In her days back home in Hawai’i, Danielle was avid in singing
              anywhere she could. Besides playing at a variety of venues and
              hotels on the island, she also placed in the finals for both Don
              Ho’s showcase and Hawai’i Stars. After receiving her Bachelor’s
              degree in music from University of Hawai’i, she made the big move
              to Los Angeles.
              <br />
              <br />
              Danielle makes up half of pop-duo band “Perry & Danielle”. The
              pair were invited to events and showcases with organizations
              including Kollaboration, Tuesday Night Project, JACCC, 18 Million
              Rising. They released their first full-length album in October
              2018 and a second EP two years later in October 2020. Perry &
              Danielle also play regularly at Splitsville in downtown Disney and
              Hotel Indigo in downtown LA.
              <br />
              <br />
              Danielle is apart of duo “Oki Talk” with DJ Oggy where they write
              and produce songs regularly. While many of their songs are EDM,
              they are unafraid of writing a mix of pop, country, R&B, and hip
              hop, making their song roster extra expansive and diverse. A
              handful of these songs can be found and used at Epic Music LA.
              Currently, the have written and produced over 50 songs, striving
              for each one to be better than the last.
